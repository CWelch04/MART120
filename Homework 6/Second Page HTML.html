<h3>The Sushi Ghost</h3>
There's a rumor that our local sushi restaurant is haunted. 
Things keep disappearing and there have been multiple occasions where things have been knocked over or fallen off of shelves.
It's such a common occurance that the workers don't really react to it any more. 
New workers are warned about "Sushi Ghost" on their first day. 
The Sushi Ghost doesn't like to be talked about. 
I personally have seen many things fall when no one was around. 
The thing that got me to believe that there could be a ghost was a pitcher falling.
The manager and I were cutting up fish and veggies for sushi. The pitchers are located on the other side of the bar.
There were four pitchers sitting on the tilted surface to drain the water out. 
The farthest pitcher suddenly fell over the <i>lip</i> of the drainer and onto the floor.
No one else was there. The two of us looked at each other with wide eyes.
The manager then chuckled and shook his head muttering, "Sushi Ghost".
Ever since then, I have firmly believed the rumors.
In homage to Sushi Ghost, I painted a ghost on the restaurant door for Halloween.
